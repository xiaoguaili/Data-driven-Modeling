Different basis functions are defined in module 'basisFunctions.py'. In the main function, which is 'Assignment2.py', there are 3 commands which can help choose different basis functions.

'basisN' helps define the highest order of basis functions. Note: To be consistent with the definitions in mathematics, 'basisN' is not the dimension of basis funcitons. The dimension varies for different basis funcitons, which are explained in the module. 

Be careful that in prediction, the computation of phi_star should also base on the same basis functions that are used in computation of w_MAP. There are also 3 commands that help choose different basis functions.
